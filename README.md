# Shopping cart

This is a simple shop website, where I used React Hooks and SCSS. In Items tab, you'll find different items to buy, and if you add them to cart, the number at top right increments. You can also remove elements from the cart in the Cart tab. Some things to improve are Cart layout and items in the store.

Thanks for checking my work!
