        This is a simple shop website, where I used React Hooks and SCSS. In
        Items tab, you'll find different items to buy, and if you add them to
        cart, the number at top right increments. You can also remove elements
        from the cart in the Cart tab. Some things to improve are Cart layout
        and items in the store.
